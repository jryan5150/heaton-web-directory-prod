## 🎯 Primary Goal

**Convert admin portal from OAuth (Microsoft/Google) to simple password-based authentication with 3 roles:**

- **Super Admin** (jryan5150@gmail.com) - Full access
- **Approver** (m.balderas@heatoneye.com) - Can approve, can't publish
- **Editor** (shared account) - Can submit changes, can't approve

---

## 📊 Architecture Overview

### Authentication Flow:
1. User visits `/admin` → Middleware checks for session cookie
2. No cookie → Redirect to `/admin/login`
3. User enters email + password
4. `/api/admin/login` verifies password against `data/users.json`
5. On success → Creates JWT session token
6. Sets HTTP-only cookie `admin-session`
7. Redirects to `/admin` dashboard

### Session Management:
- JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- 7-day expiration
- Signed with `SESSION_SECRET` env var
- Library: `jose` (lightweight JWT)

### Password Security:
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Stored in `data/users.json` as `passwordHash` field
- Never stored or transmitted in plain text

### Role-Based Access:
- Checked in middleware for route protection
- Checked in components for UI visibility
- Checked in API routes for action authorization

### Should Be Deleted:
- ❌ `src/auth.ts` - Old NextAuth config

## 🔑 Environment Variables

### Local (.env.local):
```env
SESSION_SECRET=<generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32>
RESEND_API_KEY=<from-resend.com>
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=jryan5150@gmail.com
```

### Production (Vercel):
Same as local, but with production Resend API key

### No Longer Needed:
```
# These can be removed:
NEXTAUTH_URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET
AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Local Testing (after Steps 4-6):
- [ ] Visit `/admin` → Redirects to `/admin/login`
- [ ] Login with superadmin credentials → Success
- [ ] See all 4 tabs (Employees, Pending, Versions, Users)
- [ ] Sign out → Returns to login
- [ ] Login with approver → Only 3 tabs (no Users)
- [ ] Login with editor → All tabs but limited buttons

### Production Testing (after deployment):
- [ ] Main directory at `/` is public
- [ ] Admin at `/admin` requires login
- [ ] DNS resolves staff.heatoneye.com
- [ ] SSL certificate active
- [ ] All 3 roles work
- [ ] Email notification test (manually trigger `/api/admin/notify-approved`)

## 💬 User Context & Decisions

**User:** Jace Ryan (jryan5150@gmail.com)
**Client:** Heaton Eye
**Project:** Employee directory with admin portal

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. ✅ Pivoted from OAuth to simple password auth
2. ✅ Main directory at `/` is public (no login required)
3. ✅ Admin portal at `/admin` is password-protected
4. ✅ 3-tier role system: superadmin → approver → editor
5. ✅ M. Balderas is the sole approver (for now)
6. ✅ Shared password for editors (staff)
7. ✅ Daily email summaries (not immediate notifications)
8. ✅ Email via Resend service
9. ✅ Deploy to Vercel at staff.heatoneye.com

**Deployment Timeline:**
- Steps 1-6 (Quick Demo): ~1 hour → Can share admin link
- Steps 7-12 (Full System): ~2.5 hours → Complete with emails

**Current Goal:**
Get Steps 1-6 done first for a quick demo deployment, then new Claude session for Steps 7-12 (email notifications + polish).

---

## 🚀 When New Session Starts

**User will have completed Steps 1-6** and will need help with:

### Priority 1: Clean Up OAuth (15 min)
- Delete old auth files
- Update PendingChangesPanel with editor restrictions

### Priority 2: Fix API Route Auth (20 min)
- Replace `auth()` calls with `getSessionFromCookie()`
- Update publish, rollback, users routes

### Priority 3: Email Notifications (45 min)
- Create notify-approved endpoint
- Set up Resend integration
- Create vercel.json cron config
- Test email delivery

### Priority 4: Final Polish (30 min)
- Test all roles thoroughly
- Fix any bugs
- Deploy to production
- Verify emails work

## 📝 Important Notes for New Claude

1. **Authentication is now JWT-based**, not OAuth
   - Use `getSessionFromCookie()` to get current user
   - Use role helpers: `isSuperAdmin()`, `canApprove()`, `canPublish()`

2. **All old NextAuth imports should be removed**
   - No more `useSession()` hook
   - No more `signIn()` / `signOut()` from next-auth
   - No more `SessionProvider` wrapper

3. **Middleware is critical**
   - Must use `getSessionFromRequest()` for session checks
   - Cannot use `fs` or `path` in middleware (edge runtime)

4. **Three distinct roles with clear permissions:**
   - Superadmin: Everything
   - Approver: Approve/reject only (no publish, no user management)
   - Editor: Submit changes only (no approve, no publish)

5. **Email system uses Resend**
   - Free tier: 100 emails/day (plenty for daily summaries)
   - Cron runs at 9:00 AM daily
   - Only sends if there are approved changes

6. **User accounts**: Passwords rotated and stored securely outside repo. SSO via Microsoft 365 is the primary login method for @heatoneye.com users.

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** "Session not found" on /admin
- Solution: Check SESSION_SECRET is set in .env.local

**Issue:** Login fails with correct password
- Solution: Verify password hash in users.json matches generated hash

**Issue:** Middleware error about 'fs' module
- Solution: Don't import fs/path in middleware (edge runtime limitation)

**Issue:** Email not sending
- Solution: Check RESEND_API_KEY is valid, verify email in Resend dashboard

**Issue:** Cron not running
- Solution: vercel.json must be in project root, redeploy after adding it

Good luck with the new session! 🚀

The project is in great shape - just needs the finishing touches for email notifications and final deployment testing.
