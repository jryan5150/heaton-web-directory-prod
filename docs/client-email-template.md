Dear [Client Contact Name],

I'm pleased to announce that the new Heaton Eye Staff Directory admin portal is now live at:

🔗 https://staff.heatoneye.com/admin

This secure, password-protected system replaces the previous OAuth-based authentication and provides enhanced control over your employee directory with a streamlined approval workflow.

## KEY FEATURES

✅ **Three-Tier Role System:**
   - Super Admin - Full control (approve, publish, manage users)
   - Approver - Review and approve/reject changes
   - Editor - Submit directory updates

✅ **Automated Email Notifications:**
   - Daily digest at 9:00 AM when changes need attention
   - Ensures nothing falls through the cracks

✅ **Version History & Rollback:**
   - Complete audit trail of all changes
   - Ability to restore previous versions if needed

✅ **Enhanced Security:**
   - Session-based authentication with secure JWT tokens
   - Role-based access control
   - No more OAuth dependencies
