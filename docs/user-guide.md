- This is an interim solution - the workflow will eventually move to a fully automated publishing process

### When Are Emails Sent?
- Daily at 9:00 AM UTC (3:00 AM CST / 4:00 AM CDT)
- Only if approved changes are waiting to be published
- No email if no approved changes exist

### What's in the Email?
- Count of approved changes waiting
- Breakdown by type (Add, Edit, Delete)
- Direct link to admin portal
- Professional Heaton Eye branding

### Sample Email Content

```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't log in / "Invalid credentials"

**Solution:**
- ✓ Verify email address is correct (case-sensitive)
- ✓ Verify password is exact (case-sensitive, includes special chars)
- ✓ Try copying password directly from this guide
- ✓ Contact support if password needs reset

### Don't see "Approve" button on pending changes

**Solution:**
- ✓ Check your role: Editors cannot approve changes
- ✓ Editor role sees "Awaiting Approval" badge instead
- ✓ Only Approvers and Super Admins can approve

### Don't see "Publish" button

**Solution:**
- ✓ Only Super Admin can publish changes
- ✓ Approvers will see message about waiting for Super Admin
- ✓ This feature is restricted to Super Admin role only

### Don't see "Users" tab

**Solution:**
- ✓ Only Super Admin has access to user management
- ✓ Approvers and Editors cannot manage users
- ✓ This is expected behavior for security

### Changes not appearing on public directory

**Solution:**
- ✓ Verify changes have been published (not just approved)
- ✓ Check staff.heatoneye.com to confirm
- ✓ Try hard refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- ✓ Allow 30 seconds for CDN cache to clear

### Didn't receive email notification

**Solution:**
- ✓ Emails only sent if approved changes exist
- ✓ Emails sent once per day at 9:00 AM UTC
- ✓ Check spam/junk folder
- ✓ Email notifications are currently sent to Super Admin only
- ✓ Manually check portal instead of waiting for email

## Security Best Practices

### Password Security
- ✓ Change default passwords after first login
- ✓ Use strong, unique passwords (12+ characters)
- ✓ Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- ✓ Don't share passwords between users
- ✓ Store passwords in secure password manager

### Account Security
- ✓ Log out when finished using the portal
- ✓ Don't share login credentials
- ✓ Report suspicious activity immediately
- ✓ Use private/incognito browser on shared computers

### Session Management
- ✓ Sessions expire after 7 days of inactivity
- ✓ You'll need to log in again after expiration
- ✓ This protects against unauthorized access

### Data Protection
- ✓ Only submit accurate employee information
- ✓ Double-check data before submitting
- ✓ Don't submit personal/sensitive information beyond directory needs
- ✓ Version history maintains audit trail
